                         O silvery weeping willow tree <br>
                         With all leaves shivering,<br>
                         Have you no purpose but to shadow me<br>
                         Beside this rippled spring? <br>

                        We can look to the ancient Greek story of Phaeton to help cast some light on this tree of shadows. Phaeton, son of the water nymph Clymene and the sun god Helios, in his youthful arrogance was struck down by Zeus for a reckless solar joyride. His spectacular death brought his sisters low, and they wept by the river. Their bitter tears turned into amber, which took root and grew into trees along the river's banks, sprouting what we now know as weeping willows.<br></p>
                 <div class="literature-container">
                      <p class="text-bottom"> Phaeton's death, bright youth cut short, brought with it terrible grief, but also something more. His tragedy begot beauty. The sublime given urgency by the inescapable grasp of death</p>

                        Comes the unworking night.

                        Claude Monet's 'Weeping Willow' series reminds us again of this duality. Soft, wavering lines and dark, muted colors, anguish given form. Monet painted the series of ten towards the end of World War One, in mournful response to the horrors and futility of war. His creative fervour heightened by the conscription of his two sons to the front line.<br> </p>

                    <p class="text-two-then">    Monet summed this up in a letter to his dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in June 1918: “What an agonizing life we all are living, I continue... to work, although at times, I long to give it all up”.<br></p>
                        
                     <p class="text-two-final">   Did Monet's willow serve only to draw his heart further into despair, or did it lend him the strength to carry on? Did the tree symbolize death or beauty, loss or art?</p>

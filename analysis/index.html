                        Many a willow tree can be found bordering water, with the famous weeping willow tending to grow right on the bank of a river or stream. A perfect spot to repose and let the mind wander, much like in Rosetti's poem. The harsh light of the sun is filtered into soft shade. This juxtaposition of earth and water, permanence and transience, as well as light and shadow, lends itself well to philosophising. Perhaps it's physical position as a gatekeeper between domains is also part of why the willow is often associated with death or grieving.

                     What then of the willow's 'purpose'? From willow comes wicker, a font of creative expression from our earliest years. Pliable, flexible, adaptable. What better medium for art, what better reminder of our strengths? The willow suffers and recovers. The willow regrows.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-two-middle">Often called 'natures aspirin' willow bark has long been used as a pain killer, helping to ease our suffering when all else fails. From grief comes shock. The sudden impact upon the bell of our hearts can reverberate for a long, long time. But again, what better avatar for grief than the willow? A wood so resilient that we even use it for cricket bats. A tool built to weather blow after blow. A wood that endures.<br></p>

                    <p class="text-two-end">The parable of the oak and the reed presents us with a choice, strength or flexibility, but in the willow we have both. If grief and pain are inevitable, then to weep is not a sign of weakness. Rather it is a vital part of the process by which we wash our pain away and regain our strength</p>

                        The willow tree, beguiling and forlorn, has long been seen as a symbol of woe. The poet Christina Rossetti perfectly captures the heaving melancholy the willow can evoke in her poem 'In the Willow Shade'.<br></p>

                     <p class="text-three-middle">  Crossing time and culture, we see willow trees again and again celebrated as central figures in mythology, art, and culture. But what is it about this susurrating salix that inspires people so much, and what can we learn from it? To many, the willow is always weeping and all willows weep. It is the tree of sadness, loss, and death. Indeed, the willow's power to evoke loss and lamentation has been etched on to gravestones for centuries. The soft, lachrymose curves of the willow being carved into hard permanence by many a bereft loved one. A death come too soon, a life unfulfilled, a love unrequited. What better cause for woe? What better standard-bearer for grief?</p>

                        Like the willow, we may be uprooted by the flood or shocked by painful impacts, but our roots will take hold once more, further down the stream. Those shock waves can be absorbed. We flex, we bend, we may even break. But we also endure.
